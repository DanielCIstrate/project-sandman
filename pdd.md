**PRODUCT DESIGN DOCUMENT**

The product (from henceforth referenced as the ***Product***) behind this Project (referenced as ***Project Sandman***) 
is envisioned as an application that allows for time-management/planning and which rewards users for achieving goals 
(and inputting data) through a gamification system (rewards, ranks etc., maybe penalties?)


1. **What problem does the Product solve?**

    There are many good time-management apps already present. One problem is that without proper configuration 
   or without sufficient experience with the app, the end-user will not actually use it to its fullest potential.
   
    A second problem is that even though time and tasks may be properly tracked, 
   completion of these tasks is not dependent on the app itself.<br>
   <br>
   
    1.1. **Solve motivation for users:**
    
    The idea behind gamification is to provide an incentive for the user when 
   ***solving these aforementioned problems by themselves***.<br>
   <br>
   
   1.1.1. **Solve the *Mark all as resolved* issue**
   
   The product should allow, but penalize (through these same gamification mechanisms) 
   behaviours that go against the main goals of such an app 
   (e.g. cutting corners when completing tasks, dishonest timekeeping)<br>
   <br>
   
   1.1.2. **Solves a part of the motivation paradigm - in completion to the virtual rewards system**

   There is a system of special quests that  user can participate in order to achieve real rewards (i.e. vouchers, prizes).<br>
   <br>
   
    1.2. **Solve management/prioritization problems:**
   
    The Product should also solve for the user the problem of creation of a hierarchy of priorities and summarize 
   the most profitable actions that need to be taken
   
   
   

2. **What is the target audience for this Product?**

    The target audience is **teenagers and young adults** who are often overwhelmed with a plethora 
   of opportunities/new challenges and are **most likely to postpone problems** by procrastination.
   
   The appeal of rewards through games may be higher for this audience.


3. **What are the target platforms for this Product (desktop, mobile, web, etc)?**
   
   A web interface is the targeted platform. It would be desirable to have at least some 
   form of notification via mobile.

4. **What business model would fit your Product? Free to use, in app purchases, pay to use, subscription?**

   Free to use model (obvious for all starting applications, but also due to the presence 
   of so many alternatives on the market)
